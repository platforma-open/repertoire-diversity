# Description

This block helps you measure and compare the diversity of immune cell repertoires (like T-cell or B-cell receptors) across your samples. The block can then calculate several standard diversity indices, such as the number of unique clonotypes (observed richness), estimates of the total clonotype richness (Chao1, Efron-Thisted), how evenly the clonotypes are distributed (Shannon-Wiener, Inverse Simpson), and how much of the repertoire is dominated by the most frequent clonotypes (D50, Gini). To ensure fair comparisons between samples with different sequencing depths, you can choose to normalize the data by various methods, including selecting the most abundant clonotypes or statistically downsampling to a common size, before calculating the diversity metrics.
