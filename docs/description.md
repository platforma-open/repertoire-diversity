# Overview

Calculates comprehensive diversity metrics for T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) immune repertoires to characterize and compare repertoire diversity across samples. The block processes clonotype count data from VDJ processing blocks and computes multiple standard diversity indices: observed richness (number of unique clonotypes), richness estimators (Chao1, Efron-Thisted), evenness indices (Shannon-Wiener, Inverse Simpson), and dominance measures (D50, Gini).

To ensure fair comparisons between samples with different sequencing depths, the block supports normalization methods including selecting the most abundant clonotypes or statistically downsampling to a common size using hypergeometric sampling before calculating diversity metrics. This enables robust comparison of repertoire diversity across experimental conditions, time points, or treatment groups, helping identify changes in immune repertoire composition associated with disease, vaccination, or therapeutic interventions.
